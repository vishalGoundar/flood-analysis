# Flood Analysis Project

This repository contains the modeling pipeline and code used for cyclone-phase flood prediction across six New Zealand AOIs using Random Forest, CNN, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.

## Contents
- `finalproject.ipynb`: Full pipeline including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and AOI diagnostics
- `/data`: Sample input files (if applicable)
- `/docs`: Flowcharts, figures, and visual outputs

## Models Used
- Random Forest (with hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV)
- Convolutional Neural Network (with dropout and batch normalization)
- Gradient Boosting (optimized for terrain complexity)

## How to Run
Open `finalproject.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab. All dependencies are listed in the notebook header.

## Authors
